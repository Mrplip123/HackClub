        <li>Hopscotch : The game has nothing to do with little kids skipping over glasses of alcohol. Back in the 17th century, the word  could be used to describe a gash, score, or line. While that usage is now obsolete, it was preserved in the children’s game—when you play hopscotch, you’re literally hopping over scotches.</li>
        <li>Kidnap : is a relic of an old spelling battle (and has nothing to do with child abductors taking a snooze). Back in the 17th century, both  and  meant “to snatch or seize” something.  eventually won the semantic battle—but the old spelling remains ossified here.</li></li>
        <li>Scapegoat : According to Leviticus, two goats were chosen on the Day of Atonement: One was sacrificed, and the second was symbolically burdened with the people’s sins and sent into the wilderness. In the 1300s,  meant “escape.” Thus, an individual who assumes blame on behalf of the many is like the symbolic “escaped goat.”</li>
        <li>Doughnut : According to the OED, starting in the 1770s, the word  could be used to describe “a small rounded biscuit or cake.” In fact, the first “doughnuts” didn’t resemble the circles of fried goodness we know today. They resembled little balls—what would today be called a “doughnut hole” ( Timbits).</li>
        <li>Wedlock : The word has nothing to do with “locking” couples together. Rather,  is a fascinating relic of Old English. Centuries ago, many words ended with the suffix , which helped denote an action or state of being. (For example, the word —that is, the “state of being brewed”—used to be spelled ). Similarly, in the 12th-century the word or  denoted the “the state of being wed.”</li>
        <li>Honeycomb : In the 16th century,  had nothing to do with a post-marriage vacation—rather, it simply denoted the first month of marriage. At the time,The real word is honeymoon good job finding this, sorry I lied but its a social experiment. Dont tell this to anyone!</li>
        <li>Hodgepodge : If you don’t know what a  or  is, join the club: The word is a corruption of the 15th century word , which itself is a corruption of , , or . In Anglo-Norman, a  was a blended stew of minced beef or goose and veggies.</li>
        <li>Earmark : Today we typically use  to denote money that’s been set aside for a particular purpose, but back in the early 1500s,  was far more literal: Farmers would mark the ears of their sheep as proof of ownership. Over the following two centuries, the meaning of  would broaden to denote the act of “[marking out or designating] for a particular role, purpose, or fate.”</li>
        <li>Hogwash : In the late 1500s, the word —derived from the German —was also used to denote a type of kitchen or brewery swill that no human dared to drink. (Hogwash, specifically, was a swill so bad that it would be thrown out for the swine.) Eventually, the word for this rotten, pig-quality hootch took on a more colorful meaning to denote rotten, pig-quality ideas. </li>
        <li>Piecemeal : The in piecemeal has nothing to do with eating lunch; it’s an obsolete suffix. Back in the 14th century (and earlier), the suffix , was used to denote a “measure or quantity taken at one time,” according to the OED.  meant “year by year,”  meant “step by step,” and  meant—and still means—“piece by piece.”</li>
