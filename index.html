        <li>telecommunication : This is how people send messages or talk to each other over long distances using technology like phones, the internet, or radios. It’s like magic wires and invisible waves that connect us!</li>
        <li>telecommute : This means working from home instead of going to an office. It’s like doing your job in your pyjamas while still being super productive!</li>
        <li>subjugate : This is when someone takes control over others in a way that’s not fair, making them follow orders or rules, often by force. Imagine if a mean king told everyone what to do all the time!</li>
        <li>submerge : This means to go completely under something, usually water. Think of it like when you dive underwater in a pool or sink a toy boat.</li>
        <li>surveillance : This is when someone keeps an eye on what’s happening to make sure everything is going okay. Like when your teacher watches over your class to make sure everyone is on task!</li>
        <li>supersede : This means to take the place of something older or less useful with something better or newer. Like when you get a brand-new bike and stop using your old one.</li>
        <li>lyrically : This describes something done in a way that sounds beautiful or musical. It’s like talking or writing that feels like it could be a song!</li>
        <li>stereotypically : This means doing something in a way people expect, even if it’s not true for everyone. Like thinking all cats hate water (but some cats love it!).</li>
        <li>breathlessly : This means doing something while feeling so excited, scared, or tired that your breathing becomes quick or uneven. For example, you might speak breathlessly after running fast or seeing something super exciting, like a wild animal up close!</li>
        <li>physiologically : This means anything related to how a living thing's body works and functions. For example, sweating when you're hot is your body’s response to cool yourself down!</li>
